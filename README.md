This is a classic arcade game, named 'Nik's Frogger Game'.

# SETUP

The board is divided into three parts - Grass, Road and Water. On the welcome page, the gamer is allowed to select a character of his choice to play the game. When the game starts, the initial position of the player is at the bottom center of the grass. There are bugs moving from left to right on the road with different speeds. There is a timer ticking on the top left corner of the board. The score is displayed on the top right corner. High score is displayed on the top middle of the board.

# CONTROLS

The player is controlled by the gamer using the following keys -
Left Arrow Key - Moves the player one box to the left.
Top Arrow Key - Moves the player one box to the top.
Right Arrow Key - Moves the player one box to the right.
Bottom Arrow Key - Moves the player one box to the bottow.

# OBJECTIVE

The main objective of the game is to move the player to the water using the arrow keys as many number of times in 90 seconds.

# RULES

The rule is that the player has to reach the water without colliding the bugs. There will be gems appearing in between which the player has to collect to score bonus points. Once the game ends, the gamer can restart the game by clicking 'Play Again'.

# SCORING

If the player reaches the water, he scores 1 points.
If the player collides with the bug, he scores -1 points.
If the player collides with the gems, he scores 5 points.

The gamer's score becomes the high score if his score is more than the previous high score.
